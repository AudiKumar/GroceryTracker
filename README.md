# Grocery Tracker
My family buys a lot of groceries and we forget what we have. Therefore I thought it would be a good idea to create a system to track what frozen foods are being used in order to cut down on waste. 

## How this will work 
- Expo will be used to create the application. 
    - The application itself will be a barcode scanner that sends the groceries scaned to a database, while on another screen the contents of the database will be displayed
- The database used will be DynamoDB on AWS (cause it's free!)
